# Predictive models for diagnosing middle ear disease in infancy: An overview of my Phd project
### Joshua Myers

## 1. Introduction
Infants with onset of middle ear disease early in life are at greater risk of recurrent and chronic infections throughout childhood. Diagnostic tools for identifictaion of middle ear disease in infancy could help provide timely diagnosis and appropriate management of affected children. Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) is an innovative, high-resolution test of middle ear function that captures detailed information about the middle ear. The term WAI actually refers to a family of broadband tests including absorbance and admittance. The amount of information generated, however, can make interpretation of results difficult for clinicians, who currently have to subjectively assess a graph of results to make a diagnosis. The goal of my study was to develop objective methods for interpretation of WAI resutls. 

### Research question
How can we objectively diagnose middle ear disease in infants using the innovative WAI technology?

### Overview of the study
The study was a large longitudinal study funded by the National Health and Medical Council. We recritied 700 infants at birth and followed them through infancy. We tested infants at birth, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months of age. 

### Data science issues
Data reduction was an important aspect of the research. The study was the largest of its kind to date, but the number of variables generated by the WAI test meant that we needed to be careful not to overfit the data. Data reduction strategies included data mining, principal component analysis, and using knowledge from the literature. I utilized sophisticated data wrangling and visualization techniques to prepare and present the data, including cleaning messy text data, and dealing with missing values. I needed to develop interpretable models that clinicians would be able to understand, and be happy to use in their clinical work. A major statistical issue was that of multiple measurements on subjects. Both ears of an infant were tested, the infants were tested on multiple occasions through infancy. To take these issues into account, I used techniqes such as heirachical (mixed effects) models, and robust standard errors for statistical inference. An issue with modelling was that there are large age effects on WAI resutls through infancy which need to be taken into account when developing predictive models.  

I first developed age-specific models for newborns, 6-month infants and 12-month infants. I then did a longitudinal study to investigate age effects, and used this knowledge to develop a model for 6-18 month infants that controlled for age effects. I validated the newborn model in a new sample. All models have been implemented in online web applications (link)

## 2. The newborn model
For the newborn model I developed a logistic regression model that allowed predictors to have a nonlinear association with the outcome using restricted cubic splines. I developed the model on data from one ear of subjects, and validated for overfitting using the opposite ear data, and with bootstrap resampling. Below is a figure of the raw data, showing the distribution of results for normal ears and ears with middle ear disease. 

![Figure 1. Average (median - solid and dashed lines), and distribution (interqurtile range - shaded regions) of normal (pass) and diseased ears (fail)](figures/newbornIQR.jpg)

This figure shows results of three WAI tests - absorbance at the top, admittance magnitude in the middle, and admittance phase angle at the bottom. We would expect results to be more predictive of middle ear dysfunction where there is less overlap between the normal and diseased groups. For example, absorbance (top panel) in the region of 2000 Hz may be quite predictive, since there is good separation between the normal (pass) and diseased (fail) groups. 

The data was first reduced by averaging into octave bandwidths, and predictors for the model were chosen based on previous research in the literature. Predictors were allowed to have a nonlinear association with the outcome (middle ear disease) using restricted cubic splines. Model performance was assessed with AUC, which is a number between 0 and 1 - AUC of 1 perfectly distinguishes between normal and diseased subjects, and AUC of 0.5 is no better than chance. AUC of this model was 0.88 and the validation sample AUC was 0.85, indicating that the model was not overfitting, and may generalize well to new samples. This model was published in Myers et al. (2018a)

## 3. The 6-month model
For the 6-month model used absorbance as predictors. The figure below shows the average range for normal and disesed ears. Again, the region around 1000 to 2000 Hz shows good separation between the normal and diseased groups. 

![Figure 2. Average (median) and distribution (IQR) for normal and diseased ears](figures/sixmthIQR.jpeg) 

For this model I did initial data reduction at 1/2 octave frequency averaging, and then prinicpal component analysis. The first five principal components were used as predictors in the model. The figure below shows the importance of absorbance predictors in the first five principal components. A darker shade indicates a more important predictor for that component. For example for the first principal component (PC1), 1414 to 8000 Hz are a darker shade, and therefore more important. 

![Figure 3. Principal component analysis results](figures/PCA.jpeg)

AUC results 0.89 and 0.85 in the validation sample. This model was published in Myers et al (2018b)

## 4. The 12-month model
For the 12 month model I did an ordinal model again using absorbance results. The ordinal target condition for this model was: normal, mild or severe middle ear disease. I took this approach because prior research has shown an ordinal association, and clinicians may benefit from the extra information of knowing whether the disease is likely to be mild or severe. The figure below shows absorbance results stratified by the target condition (normal, mild, severe), and does appear to show an ordinal association (i.e., a systematic decrease in absorbance from normal through to mild and then severe). 

![Figure 4. Absorbance stratified by levels of the target condition (middle ear disease)](figures/absOrdinal.jpeg)

Data reduction for this model again used 1/2 octave averaging, and predictors were selected based on prior research. The AUC for the model was 0.91 after being corrected for overfitting using bootstrap resampling. This model has been submitted for publication in Myers et al. 2019a.

## 5. The longitudinal study
The longitudinal study compared results from normal ears longitudinally to investigate the effect of age on WAI results. Mixed effects models were used to account for correlations between the data points, i.e., multiple correlated measurements made on infants. I presented results by calculating the model (least squares) means, and confidence intervals. Non-overlapping confidence intervals between age groups is evidence of a real developmental effect. The figure below shows the model means and confidence intervals for the various age groups. For example, for absorbance (top panel), results for newborns do not overlap other age groups except for around 2000 and 6000 Hz.  

![Figure 5. Model (least squares) means (lines) and 95% confidence intervals (shaded regions) by age](figures/longitudinal.jpeg)

This study has been submitted for publication Myers et al. 2019b.

## 6. The model accounting for age and the validation study
I used the knowledge gained in the longitudinal study to develop a model for infants aged 6 to 18 months that accounted for developmental age effects. This was again an ordinal model, similar to the 12-month model. AUC resutls.

I also validated the newborn model in a new sample of xxx infants. AUC resutls.

Below is a figure of applying the model to absorbance results from two infants. Each graph plots the absorbance test result (the line) against the 90% normal range (shaded region), and provides the most likely diagnosis predicted by the model. It also presents the probability that the middle ear (ME) of the subject has either mild or severe dysfunction. For the top panel

These studies have been submitted for publication Myers et al. 2019c.

## 7. Conclusions
I developed models to objectively assess WAI results for diagnosis of middle ear disease in infancy. The models could be fully automated for use in screening settings, or risk scores could be presented to clinicians along with graphical results to aid in diagnosis. 

I made the models available to clinicians by implementing it as a web application which is available [here](https://joshmyers.shinyapps.io/WAIPredictions/). To try out the model choose an age group from the "Select age" menu, then click one of the example files to download to your compluter (this is the test result that is saved by the clinican), and then upload the file with the "Browse" button to make a prediction based on the results saved in the file.
